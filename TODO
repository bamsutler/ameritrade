TODO:

- Make the construction of Config() use keyword args and use that to connect
  instead of open_with_dir(), so that we can implement ameritrade.check.

- Create a script (invocable via python3 -m ameritrade.check) to test connection
  and print out the full configuration.




- This script is one that should create the configuration the first time if it
  doesn't exist.

- Post a clear instructions on how to create a self-signed certificate with
  correct paths, maybe make this automatic even, providing a script that will
  run the commands for you if the config directory does not exist.




- Add support for PUT and PATCH methods.

- Add argument data types to schema and check them.

- Support positional arguments.

- Implement unit tests for schema validation, and perhaps move some of it to a
  dedicated module.
