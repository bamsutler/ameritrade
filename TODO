TODO:

- Make the construction of Config() use keyword args and use that to connect
  instead of open_with_dir(), so that we can implement ameritrade.check.

- Create a script (invocable via python3 -m ameritrade.check) to test the
  connection and print out the full configuration.

- two-step is how it should be; validate the configuration, add unit tests.

- cache_read, cache_write, as options.





- This script is one that should create the configuration the first time if it
  doesn't exist.

- Post a clear instructions on how to create a self-signed certificate with
  correct paths, maybe make this automatic even, providing a script that will
  run the commands for you if the config directory does not exist. ACTUALLY YOU
  CAN'T DO THIS, YOU HAVE TO DOWNLOAD THE SECRETS FILE FROM THE WEBSITE, THERE'S
  NO WAY AROUND THAT.




- Add support for PUT and PATCH methods.

- Add argument data types to schema and check them.

- Support positional arguments, maybe?

- Implement unit tests for schema validation, and perhaps move some of it to a
  dedicated module.
