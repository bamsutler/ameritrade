TODO:

- Consider merging AMERTRADE_CONFIG_DIR to ~/.ameritrade and make a client_id
  file in there and all certificate files in there.

- Add support for PUT and PATCH methods.

- Add argument data types and check them.

- Post a clear instructions on how to create a self-signed certificate with
  correct paths, maybe make this automatic even, providing a script that will
  run the commands for you.

- Download return value schemas and integrate them.

- Support positional arguments.

- Implement unit tests for schema validation, and perhaps move some of it to a
  dedicated module.
