=== CHANGES: ameritrade ===


2018-10-04

  - Ported all the code to a single open() call, with multiple configuration
  creation calls

  - Created check.py, a module that just prints and tests the config.

  - Pull the client id from the '$AMERITRADE_DIR/config/client_id' file instead
    of having to be brought it.

  - Changed the environment variables to a single variable 'AMERITRADE_DIR'
    which contains both the cache and the configuration directory.

  - Added lazy option to the API in order to take full advantage of the cache
    while developing, and not even having to reconnect if everything requested
    has been cached.

  - Added function to build a CUSIP given an Option.

    'payload' and is directly validated against the schemas provided by the API
    documentation.

  - Implemented POST method.

    significantly extends the duration of valid login credentials.
