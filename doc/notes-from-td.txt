(Q&A w/ TD API PM, from August 2018)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q. The timeout is pretty short, I’m typing my password all day long it seems. Is
   there a way to increase the timeout?

A. The time out setting is associated with the Time Out setting through
   www.TDAmeritrade.com -> Client Services tab -> General. Also, throughout the
   App, you should be able to generate access_tokens with your existing
   refresh_token. Refresh tokens are valid for 90 days. They are used to
   generate access tokens which are valid for 30 minutes. After that 30 minutes
   is up, you will need to generate another access token, but there should not
   be a need to log in with your TD Ameritrade information because you already
   have an access token.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q. I wrote Python bindings to your API. I’d like to auto-generate them. Some of
   the responses in your documentation pages already appear to have a
   description of the schema for responses in JSON. Do you have a file that
   describes the schema of your entire API, including the input functions? Can
   you share it?

A. This is something we are putting together, but do not have an ETA at this
   time on when that will be finished. What were some of the questions you had
   around it?

R. I wrote the schema in code like this:
   https://bitbucket.org/blais/ameritrade/src/tip/ameritrade/schema.py
   Ideally this would not be necessary and the method parsers be auto-generated
   from your schema file. (When you update the API, the bindings would just get
   updated from a new schema file version automatically.) Moreover, I could
   verify the validity of all the input value strings themselves if I had the
   full schema. I might even generate a protocol buffer translation layer if I
   had it, so I could use it consistently from any language. That's all.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q. The API page does not require security questions (like the regular website
   does). Are you planning to let users upload / install a required certificate
   in order to increase the security of this API?

A. 2 factor authentication is something we will be adding across our API. This
   was recently added to the thinkorswim platform and our mobile platforms.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q. Adding an API to download the list of each ETF holdings would be a nice
   add-on to the service. If you have a normalized feed of this information
   within. (I had to build a hodgepodge project elsewhere to do this so far.)

A. The workaround for this is to use the public list we have within the
   thinkorswim platform. This is housed inside thinkorswim so you can not use
   the API to reference this list. You can export and import the list again into
   a personal list. Once done, you will be able to access it with your app
   through the watchlist api.
